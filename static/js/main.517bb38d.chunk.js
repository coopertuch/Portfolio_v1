This project is intended for use by new friends, old friends, family, anyone you hope to get closer to or have some fun with. So often we are paralyzed by social interactions and overthinking that we don't even begin to converse with each other, always resorting to small talk; I've been doing well, the weather is good, so was my weekend. While you may not want to get into personal details with co-workers, this project offers a variety of (growing) categories and questions to spark up conversations with each other; spend some time debating whether savory or sweet is better, or maybe come to the realization that you both love the same movies. For those who seek to enrich or rebuild existing relationships with friends or family, there are even more questions for you. Sometimes all it takes is one question to start meaningful conversations and open the door to connection. A huge thank you to the Banana Boyz, or \"BB'z\" for short, for inspiring this app idea!

There is full CRUD functionality for workouts and lifts, with required user authentication. WeWorkout is deployed to Heroku, and is responsive for desktop and mobile. On the Home/Workout page, workouts are listed with the user's name and muscle group, followed by form, breathing, and progression tips; users can add workouts from this page using the + sign. Clicking into a workout will then display all lifts associated with that user's muscle group, with the exercise, desired reps, and weight; users can add lifts from this page using the + sign, in addition to being able to edit and delete both the workout and lift info from this page. The Lifts page will display all lifts, where users can click on lifts to view, edit, or delete. To add, edit, or delete workouts and lifts, users must sign up and be logged in; users do not need to be logged in to just view workouts and lifts.
